## Changes Made Based On Feed Back

Based on feedback received from the previous assignment, several changes have been implemented to the project. The most significant change was fixing the alphabetical ordering of Recipes when they are displayed. Instead of manually sorting the list, the C# method OrderBy on the List class has been utilized to automate the ordering process, which will improve the efficiency of the program and made it more user-friendly.
Unused code, such as commented code, has been removed to improve the overall readability and clarity of the codebase. Clearer referencing has also been added to make it easier for other developers to understand and work with the project.

## Minimum Requirements 

Operating system

Windows 10 or higher

Hardware

ARM64 or x64 processor; Quad-core or better recommended. ARM 32 processors are not supported.
Minimum of 4 GB of RAM. Many factors impact resources used; we recommend 16 GB RAM for typical professional solutions.
Windows 365: Minimum 2 vCPU and 8 GB RAM. 4 vCPU and 16 GB of RAM recommended.
Hard disk space: Minimum of 850 MB up to 210 GB of available space, depending on features installed; typical installations require 20-50 GB of free space. We recommend installing Windows and Visual Studio on a solid-state drive (SSD) to increase performance.
Video card that supports a minimum display resolution of WXGA (1366 by 768); Visual Studio will work best at a resolution of 1920 by 1080 or higher.
Minimum resolution assumes zoom, DPI settings, and text scaling are set at 100%. If not set to 100%, minimum resolution should be scaled accordingly. For example, if you set the Windows display ‘Scale and layout’ setting on your Surface Book, which has a 3000x2000 physical display, to 200%, then Visual Studio would see a logical screen resolution of 1500x1000, meeting the minimum 1366x768 requirement.
